          Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a part of our daily lives 
          providing solutions that enhance convenience and productivity and 
          efficiency. In personal management, AI-powered virtual assistants like 
          Siri and Alexa and Google Assistant help us perform tasks such as setting 
          reminders and sending messages or even controlling smart home devices with 
          voice commands. Smart home systems like Nest thermostats or Ring security 
          cameras use AI to learn patterns and save energy and enhance home security and 
          allowing us to control appliances remotely and monitor activities in 
          real-time.
